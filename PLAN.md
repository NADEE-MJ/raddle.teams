# Raddle Teams - Development Plan

## üéØ Game Concept

Raddle Teams is a web-based multiplayer word chain puzzle game inspired by [Raddle.quest](https://raddle.quest). Teams collaborate to solve word chains by connecting two words using clues.

### How Word Chains Work

Players receive a **start word** and **end word**, then must find the intermediate words using clues:

```
DOWN -----> EARTH
```

**Available Clues** (out of order):
- Cardinal direction that's DOWN on a map, most of the time
- Change the first letter of DOWN to get a part of the body
- Kind of food or music that sounds like DOWN
- Move the first letter of DOWN to the end to get where we are
- Organ that sits inside the DOWN
- Piece of clothing that often has a DOWN
- Popular piano duet "________ & DOWN"
- Rubber layer on the bottom of a DOWN

### Solving Process

**Forward Direction (DOWN ‚Üí EARTH):**
1. Next word after DOWN is **5 letters**
2. Answer: **SOUTH** (Cardinal direction that's DOWN on a map)
3. Next word after SOUTH is **5 letters**
4. Answer: **MOUTH** (Change first letter of SOUTH to get a body part)
5. Continue until reaching EARTH...

**Backward Direction (EARTH ‚Üê DOWN):**
Players can also work backwards from EARTH, with clues reversed:
- "Move the first letter of _______ to the end to get where we are ‚Üí EARTH"
- Answer: **HEART**

### Game Rules

- **Exact matches only**: All words must be CAPITALIZED and exact
- **Bidirectional solving**: Teams can work forward, backward, or switch directions
- **First correct wins**: When any team member solves a word, it advances the whole team
- **No waiting**: Teams work independently at their own pace

## üë• Team-Based Gameplay

### Lobby System (Jackbox Style)

1. **Player Join**: Everyone joins on their phone with chosen names
2. **Admin Control**: Admin sees all players and manages the game
3. **Team Formation**: Admin sets number of teams, players randomly assigned
4. **Team Names**: Players have limited time to choose team names
5. **Game Start**: Teams compete to solve puzzles fastest

### Real-Time Collaboration

**Team Features:**
- **Live submissions**: See every guess from teammates in real-time
- **Dual direction work**: Members can work forward/backward simultaneously
- **Shared progress**: When one member solves, everyone advances
- **Guess history**: Full backlog of attempts for current words
- **Optimistic locking**: First correct submission wins

**Winning Condition:**
- First team to complete all assigned puzzles wins
- Teams work independently (no waiting for others)

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + SQLite)

**Core Technologies:**
- **FastAPI**: Web server with REST API endpoints
- **WebSockets**: Real-time team communication
- **SQLite**: Player progress, teams, and game state
- **Poetry**: Python dependency management

**Database Design:**
- Player information and session management
- Team assignments and progress tracking
- Real-time game state synchronization
- Automatic reconnection support

**Optimistic Locking System:**
1. Lock team submissions for specific word
2. Process the correct answer
3. Broadcast to all team members
4. Release lock for next word

### Puzzle Data Structure

Puzzles stored as JSON files:

```json
{
  "title": "Tutorial Puzzle",
  "ladder": [
    {
      "word": "DOWN",
      "clue": "Cardinal direction that's <> on a map, most of the time",
      "transform": "MEANS"
    },
    {
      "word": "SOUTH",
      "clue": "Change the first letter of <> to get a part of the body",
      "transform": "S->M"
    },
    {
      "word": "MOUTH",
      "clue": "Organ that sits inside the <>",
      "transform": "CONTAINS THE"
    },
    etc...
    {
      "word": "EARTH",
      "clue": null,
      "transform": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

**Core Technologies:**
- **React 18**: Modern hooks and context
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time updates

**Design Philosophy:**
- Minimal, bare-bones interface
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Real-time collaboration focus
