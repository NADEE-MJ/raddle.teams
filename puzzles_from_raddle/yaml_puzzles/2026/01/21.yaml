  message: "In March of 1965, King led thousands of nonviolent protesters on a 5-day, 54-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.
    On the steps of the capitol in Montgomery, King proclaimed: “The end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience.
    And that will be a day not of the white man, not of the black man. That will be the day of man as man.”"
