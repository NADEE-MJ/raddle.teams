  message: No person is more closely associated with the civil rights movement of mid-20th century America than King, and few have left behind as powerful a legacy.
    King was present when, on July 2, 1964, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the historic Civil Rights Act in a nationally televised ceremony at the White House.
    His work as an activist continued until his assassination in 1968.
