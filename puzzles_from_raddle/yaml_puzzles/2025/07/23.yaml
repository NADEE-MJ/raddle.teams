  title: From OPTICS to DESIGN
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Severance
  message:
    Optics & Design is a department of Lumon Industries in âSeverance.â 
    Like much of the TV show, the department is shrouded in mystery. 
    It oversees the installation of paintings in the office, which are unsettling and inscrutable at best, and often, upon further inspection, deeply filled with lore.
