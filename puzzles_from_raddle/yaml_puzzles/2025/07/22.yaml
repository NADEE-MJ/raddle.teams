  title: From MACRO to DATA
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Severance
  message:
    In âSeverance,â some Lumon employees work on Macrodata Refinement, a procedure as vague as its name suggests. 
    At their desktop computers, they sort four sets of numbers into five bins, with each set provoking strong emotions in each employee.
    You may find some of these clues vague, but thereâs nothing here as scary as a set of Category 1 numbers.
