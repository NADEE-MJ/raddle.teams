  message:
    This week, in observation of Independence Day, we're celebrating inventions from around 250 years ago.
    During the French Revolution in 1790, a commission of the French Academy of Sciences created a [standardized metric system](https://usma.org/origin-of-the-metric-system), which met the need for âan invariable standard for all the measures and all the weights.â 
    The metric system is used by a vast majority of countries today, though some (like the U.K. and Canada) use a mixture of metric and imperial, while the U.S. maintains a fierce grip on its precious inches and pounds.
