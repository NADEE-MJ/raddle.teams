    Weâre still riding the wave of bicycle-themed Raddles this week.
    The Ferris Wheel was designed and produced for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, in our hometown, Chicago, by a civil engineer named George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. 
    Similar contraptions had existed centuries earlier around the world, but this one set records of engineering, coming in at 264 foot tall, and supporting 36 cars that could each hold up to 60 people.
