  title: From CIRCULAR to SAW
  author: Mao Reynolds and Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: 250-year-old creations
  message:
    This week, in observation of Independence Day, we're celebrating inventions from around 250 years ago.
    The circular saw has a fittingly circuitous origin. 
    Samuel Miller received a British patent for the circular saw in 1777;
    and a German man named Gervinus built a similar machine in 1780; 
    and a Shaker woman in Massachusetts named Tabitha Babbitt created her own contraption in 1810 but didn't patent it due to her religious beliefs.
