  title: From DEFIANT to JAZZ
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Severance
  message:
    We are introduced to âDefiant Jazzâ in S1E7 of âSeverance,â 
    In the episode, department supervisor Milchick throws Helly R. a âMusic Dance Experience,â 
    allowing her to choose from a list of colorfully named genres. 
    Defiant Jazz is the correct choice, but I fall asleep at night wondering what Effusive Ska and Reckless Disco could be.
