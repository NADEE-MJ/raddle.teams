  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Tour de France
  message: 
    Itâs the Tour de France this week, and weâre honoring it with bike-themed Raddles. 
    Named after the grips on a bike, the handlebar mustache is synonymous with the Wild West, Mr. Monopoly, and hipsters. 
    It grew in popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, even garnering its own society, the Handlebar Club, which was established in 1947.
