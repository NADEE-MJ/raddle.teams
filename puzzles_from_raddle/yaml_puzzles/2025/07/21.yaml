  title: From INNIE to OUTIE
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Severance
  message:
    "\"Severance\" earned 27 Emmy nominations last week. In the show, employees of Lumon live two separate consciousness:
    one in the outside world, and one that exists only on the office's severed floor. 
    These indentities are referred to as \"outies\" and \"innies\", and they switch between them as they take the elevator at the start and end of the workday.
    This week we'll dive into the world of Severance, spoiler-free.
    Though we do recommend you play the [Severance theme](https://open.spotify.com/track/2dssT0G1eXmqLoNIzKEuxN?si=b79efc34ea414074) while solving."
