  message:
    This week, in observation of Independence Day, we're celebrating inventions from around 250 years ago.
    Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1794, a landmark for American manufacturing (and a blessing to crossword constructors, who love to include ELI). 
    The âginâ of a cotton gin is a shortening of âengine.â 
    Hand-cranked cotton gins worked by straining fibers through mesh, speeding up the rate of cotton production. 
    Unfortunately, because the machine allowed for more efficient processing of cotton, it strengthened the demand for slave labor across the American South.
