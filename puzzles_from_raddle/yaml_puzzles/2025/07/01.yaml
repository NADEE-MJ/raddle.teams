  message:
    This week, in observation of Independence Day, weâre celebrating inventions from around 250 years ago.
    In 1775, a Scottish watchmaker named Alexander Cummings received a patent for the flushable toilet. 
    The toilet had been invented and improved for thousands of years, but Cummings' invention included an S-shaped pipe below the toilet bowl, which prevented the spread of foul odors. 
    Contrary to the popular myth, Thomas Crapper didnât have much to do with the modern toilet, besides developing a tank-filling mechanism called the ballcock.
