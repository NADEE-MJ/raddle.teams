  title: From FOOD to CHAIN
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Tour de France
  message: 
      The Tour de France is this week and weâre honoring it with bike-themed Raddles. 
      Like a well-oiled bicycle chain, a food chain keeps things in an ecosystem chugging along. 
      The concept of food chains was developed first by al-Jahiz, an 8th-century scholar in modern-day Iraq, and was later independently developed by an English ecologist named Charles Elton.
