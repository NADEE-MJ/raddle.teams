  title: From TIRE to SWING
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Tour de France
  message:
    Today is another stage of the Tour de France, the weeks-long cycling trek happening right now across (you guessed it) France.
    In the race, if a participantâs tires are punctured or go flat, they signal to a team car and are immediately given new wheels. 
    Going on a tire swing is a much less risky endeavor. I recommend it.
