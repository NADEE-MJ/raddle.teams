  title: From KAL to EL
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Superman
  message:
      It's Superman week! Superman was born Kal-El on the planet Krypto.
      His parents were Jor-El and Lara. "Kal-El" apparently translates to "Star Child" in Kryptonian.
      Which, assuming he was given that name before he left the planet, is some solid bit of nominative determinism.
