  message: "I'm turning 49 this week. 49 is 7x7, so I'm celebrating with seven sets
    of seven: seven Raddles that go from the first to the seventh.
    (And today is my birthday, so you'll forgive me for indulging in a bit of Gen X nostalgia.)
    According to the Catholic Church, the seven deadly sins are lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride. This specific set isn’t actually mentioned in the Bible; the first person to classify them was Tertullian, who lived in the second century. The worst sin is often believed to be pride, hence the phrase “Pride goeth before a fall.”"
