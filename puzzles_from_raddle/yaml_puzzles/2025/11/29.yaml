  title: From ALICE'S to RESTAURANT
  author: Sandy Weisz and Bailey Holtz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Thanksgiving 2025
  message: Alice’s Restaurant is the name of a [1967 Arlo Guthrie song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaKIX6oaSLs), which many families listen to each year as a Thanksgiving tradition. The song is 18 minutes long and features a humorous monologue about an experience Guthrie had one Thanksgiving — ultimately becoming more about the Vietnam War than about Thanksgiving.
