  title: From FOUR to SQUARE
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds

  message:
    One popular block party game is four square, where players in a 2x2 grid bounce the ball to each other’s squares while trying to get other players to miss. It’s an easy option for outdoor block parties because the playing area can be made with a few strokes of chalk on the pavement.
