  title: From BOUNCY to HOUSE
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Block Party
  message:
    Bouncy houses and other inflatable structures are common sights at block parties.
    The bouncy house we know today was invented in 1958 by John Scurlock, who taught at Tulane University and also worked for NASA — but Scurlock’s wife, Frances, was the one who thought of renting out the inflatable houses for parties.
