  title: From ROAST to TURKEY
  author: Sandy Weisz and Bailey Holtz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Thanksgiving 2025
  message:
    The centerpiece of a Thanksgiving meal is traditionally a roast turkey, tho some adventurous chefs will find other, more flavorful ways to cook it.
    For some non-meat eaters, the Thanksgiving centerpiece isn’t a roast turkey but a Tofurkey, an ovoid hunk of vital wheat gluten filled with wild rice. Tofurkeys can also be tossed around the backyard after dinner, should they be deemed inadequate as food.
