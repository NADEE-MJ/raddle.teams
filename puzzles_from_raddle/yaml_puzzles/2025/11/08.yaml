    Capture the Flag was recorded as early as 1860 in a German gymnastics manual.
    The “flag” doesn’t have to be an actual banner; it can be a lantern, flashlight, glow stick or anything else on hand. A similar game, Zarnitsa, was invented in the Soviet Union and was even honored with a postage stamp.
