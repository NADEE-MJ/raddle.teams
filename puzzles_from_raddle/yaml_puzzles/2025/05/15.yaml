  message: We're honoring the Tony nominations this week. 
    "[Buena Vista Social Club](https://www.tonyawards.com/shows/buena-vista-social-club/)" earned 10 Tony nominations this year (tied for the most this year), including Best Musical, Best Direction, Best Choreography, and Best Performance.
    It's based on the best-selling album and documentary film of the same name,
    featuring a group of Cuban musicians who came together in the 1990s to perform traditional Cuban music to international audiences.
    I used to listen to that album _a lot_ in college.
