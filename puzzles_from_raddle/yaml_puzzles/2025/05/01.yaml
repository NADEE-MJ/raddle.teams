  message: "Welcome to **RUDDLE**! For the next few days, we'll be rebranding as the only Paul Rudd-themed daily word game.
    We're starting with Paul's breakout role in Amy Heckerling's Clueless, where he plays the charming
    Josh, a goateed Nietzsche-reading college boy who patiently negs Alicia Silverstoneâs Cher until she realizes she is in love with him, 
    thereby teaching Gen X some really weird things about relationships."
