  title: From GAMBLER to MARIONETTE

  theme: Blood on the Clocktower
  message: It's Blood on the Clocktower Week. ([See Day 1's note](https://raddle.quest/2025/05/19).) And it's time to delve into evil.
    The [Marionette](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Marionette) is a Minion â which means they work for the evil team.
    However, they start the game *thinking* they are a good character â in this case, the [Gambler](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Gambler). 
    Then they spend the game getting false info but thinking it's true, which is a big
    boon for the side of evil. It's up to the Demon to tell the Marionette who they are.
    In this case, the Marionette-as-Gambler is spending the game guessing people's roles and thinking they were getting them all correctly. 
    Nothing as dangerous as a gambler on an artificial hot streak.
