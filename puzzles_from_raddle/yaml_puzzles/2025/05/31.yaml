  title: From DOLL to SOUND
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Eurovision
  message:
    It's Eurovision week! 
    Luxembourg's entry is "La PoupÃ©e Monte Le Son", by artist Laura Thorn. It translates to the "Doll Turns Up the Sound", and it's an
    homage to the 1965 Eurovision winner "PoupÃ©e de cire, poupÃ©e de son" by France Gall, which was the first song to win in the pop genre.
    "PoupÃ©e de son" means "rag doll", but "son" also means "sound", leading to the double meaning of the 2025 entry.
    [Here is Laura Thorn's live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVHu_KwHiKY&t=4s) from the finals.
