  title: From DOLL to SOUND
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Eurovision
  message:
    It's Eurovision week! 
    Luxembourg's entry is "La Poupée Monte Le Son", by artist Laura Thorn. It translates to the "Doll Turns Up the Sound", and it's an
    homage to the 1965 Eurovision winner "Poupée de cire, poupée de son" by France Gall, which was the first song to win in the pop genre.
    "Poupée de son" means "rag doll", but "son" also means "sound", leading to the double meaning of the 2025 entry.
    [Here is Laura Thorn's live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVHu_KwHiKY&t=4s) from the finals.
