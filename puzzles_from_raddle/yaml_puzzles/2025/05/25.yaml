  message: "It's Blood on the Clocktower Week. ([See Day 1's note](https://raddle.quest/2025/05/19).) 
    The [Damsel](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Damsel) is an Outsider â which means she's playing for Good, but also a liability for Good.
    If the Evil team figures out who the Damsel is, they can immediately win the game. Meanwhile, there's also a Huntsman in the game, hunting for the Damsel.
    If they find her before the Evil team does, she gets 'saved', and turned into a townsfolk. In this case, she turns into a the [Knight](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Knight), 
    and immmediately
    learns two people who are definitively *not* the Demon. Late in the game, this can be really powerful!"
