  title: From PHILOSOPHER to SAILOR

  theme: Blood on the Clocktower
  message: My favorite game is [Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/), 
    a social deduction game that is endlessly replayable due to volume and variety of character options.
    Each character has a special ability, and most of them involve learning information about other players, 
    or affecting other players' info (or existence) in some way. 
    But a few special characters actually get to embody other characters, either by taking their power or pretending to be them for Reasons. 
    The archetypal example of this is the [Philosopher](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Philosopher), who gets to pick another character and earn their power. 
    In today's Raddle, the Philosopher is turning into their friend, the [Sailor](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Sailor).
