  difficulty: medium
  theme: Paul Ruddle
  message: "Welcome to **RUDDLE**! This week we're rebranding as the only Paul Rudd-themed daily word game.
    Today's puzzle is about his new movie Friendship, which is about to come out. It co-stars comedian Tim Robinson, of \"I Think You Should Leave\" fame.
    Raddle has received no compensation for this promotion, but as a fan of Rudd, Robinson, and the concept of friendship, I'm happy to do it."
