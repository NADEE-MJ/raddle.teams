  theme: Tony nominations
  message: We're honoring the Tony nominations this week. Today's puzzle is a tribute to "[Oh, Mary!](https://www.ohmaryplay.com/)", the campy retelling of Mary Todd Lincoln's presence in The White House in the days before the end of the Civil War. It was nominated for Best Play, along with five others. The best words I have for it are "unhinged" and "hilarious."
