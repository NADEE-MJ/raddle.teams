  title: From MOUNT to HOLLY
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Blue Prince
  message: Mount Holly is the name of the manor at the center of Blue Prince. ([See yesterday's Raddle](/2025/04/21).) 
    It has 45 rooms, and every day the doors in the manor open up to different rooms in a different arrangement.
    If you're lucky, you'll find some new rooms every day, which might hold some items you need to get closer to solving the mystery.
