  message: "[This week](/2025/04/01), I'm building Raddles around acts we saw at Big Ears. Our first show was [Rich Ruth](https://thirdmanrecords.com/collections/rich-ruth), a Nashville-based musician who plays an entrancing style of ambient instrumental music. Jazzy, synthy, and a little bit spacey, Ruth and his band set the perfect tone for kicking things off."
