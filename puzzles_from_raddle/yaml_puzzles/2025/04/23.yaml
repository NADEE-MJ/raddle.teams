  title: From ROGUE to LIKE
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Blue Prince
  message: A roguelike is a genre of video games that are distinguished by procedurally generated rooms that you have to explore (i.e. a dungeon crawler), and where death is permanent,
    so you have to start each play from the beginning. Blue Prince ([see Monday's Raddle](/2025/04/21).) is a roguelike (or maybe a "roguelike") because each day you
    start over in an empty manor, and each door you open can be one of many different rooms. Of course you, the human player, are encouraged to take notes, so
    you start each day a little smarter about how to win the game.
