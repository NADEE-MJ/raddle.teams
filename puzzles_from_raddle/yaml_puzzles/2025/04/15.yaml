  title: From BLOOD to FROG
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Passover
  message: One of the central traditions of Passover is recounting the ten plagues that God inflicted on the Egyptians. We recite them one by one. The first plague is Blood, which refers to the Nile River turning to blood. The second plague, Frogs, refers to an infenstation of frogs that swarmed the land. Though I recently saw a meme going around that suggests it might have just been [one big frog](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/ivish9/the_plague_of_frog/).
