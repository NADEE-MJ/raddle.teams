  title: From ORVILLE to PECK
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Some of my favorite bands
  message: I discovered Orville Peck after his first album [Pony](https://open.spotify.com/album/3950FHVErcINW3tjRgjebQ?si=6wJdIDI0QKqrkytCQWc10Q) came out in 2018, and it became a salve for me during the early days of the pandemic. He's the best masked queer country singer out there. Start with Pony, but don't miss his recent duo with Willie Nelson, [Cowboys are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other](https://open.spotify.com/track/06WARzJ6c5GYC9gSEmvO0q?si=c41ef69a26c64b70).
