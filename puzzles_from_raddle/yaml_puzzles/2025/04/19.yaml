  title: From FOUR to QUESTIONS
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Passover
  message: The Four Questions (Ma Nishtana) are a tradition in the seder where we ask, "Why is this night different from all other nights?" 
    Traditionally, this is done by the youngest attendee around the table, though it's often the case that the youngest is often the shiest, 
    and/or the least able to remember the song, and so the responsibility goes to their older sibling. Ask me how I know.
