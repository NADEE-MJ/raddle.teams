  title: From NEKO to CASE
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Some of my favorite bands
  message: Neko Case is particularly special to my wife and I because the album [Mass Romantic](https://open.spotify.com/album/7GG0z7TgUMeCr35TvMMhNR?si=Ix5cqGPuQsy0jG5u6JpIZw) (from her band The New Pornographers), was the soundtrack of the beginning of our courtship. I could listen to her song [Magpie to the Morning](https://open.spotify.com/album/3gMzehYCxYMrW6pYlcThWJ?si=AsvRF9A2QXuma6hVjk3qpQ) forever on repeat.
