  message: "Continuing with the music theme of the last week, this week I'm making Raddles inspired by some favorite bands. Today's puzzle honors the creative minds of [OK Go](https://okgo.net/shows/), who I've been following since I saw them on the local access dance show [Chic-a-Go-Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0nTc_CIPy4). They're about to launch [their tour](https://okgo.net/shows/), and we're stoked to see them in Chicago."
