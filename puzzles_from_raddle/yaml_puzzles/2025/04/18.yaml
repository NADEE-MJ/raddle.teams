  title: From GOAT to CAT
  author: Sandy Weisz
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Passover
  message: At the end of the Seder we traditionally sing "[One Little Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Gadya)" ("Chad Gadya"). It's a cumulative song â each verse adds a new character to the story. The first verse is about a goat, the second verse is about a cat that eats the goat, and so on. I considered writing Raddles that traverse the whole chain in the song, but I didn't want to burden myself with finding a chain from ANGEL OF DEATH to THE HOLY ONE BLESSED BE HE. Please enjoy [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_2WtzqvzM) of Jack Black singing the song.
