  title: From ELEVATED to TRAIN
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Chicago
  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that are strongly associated with Chicago, our home town. 
    The train is something many Chicagoans either ride or hear every day. 
    The first elevated railway was built in 1830s London, but the Chicago âLâ is recognizable in its own right, being one of three train systems in the world with 24-hour service (the others being in New York and Copenhagen).
