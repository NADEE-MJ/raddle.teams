  title: From IMPROV to COMEDY
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Chicago
  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that are strongly associated with Chicago, our home town. 
    Improv comedy has been around for millennia, but the modern "rules" of improv were formalized by Chicagoâs Second City troupe in the â50s and â60s. 
    Notable alumni of Second City â and there are many, and the number keeps growing â include Stephen Colbert, Joan Rivers, Eugene Levy, Tina Fey, Tim Robinson, and Dan Aykroyd.
