  title: From DEEP to DISH
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Chicago
  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. 
    Deep dish pizza is a food synonymous with the city; it was invented here in 1943. 
    Visitors will often make a pilgrimage to one of the cityâs many famous deep dish pizzerias, such as Lou Malnatiâs or Giordanoâs.
    Most Chicagoans donât eat it often â itâs more of a special treat â instead preferring Chicagoâs other signature pizza style, the thin-crusted tavern-style.
