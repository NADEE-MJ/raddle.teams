  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that are strongly associated with Chicago, our home town. 
    The two-flat is a distinctive architectural feature of Chicago, often brick or graystone and having two stories, an apartment on each floor, with bay windows on the front. 
    At the time of their development in the early 1900s, two-flats offered much-needed affordable housing and stability.
