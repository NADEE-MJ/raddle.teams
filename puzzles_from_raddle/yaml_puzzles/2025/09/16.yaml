  title: From SIXTEEN to INCH
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Chicago
  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. 
    Sixteen-inch softball is a variation of softball played, quite dangerously, with bare hands and slow pitches. It results, unsurprisingly, in lots of broken or dislocated fingers. 
    But it's a lot of fun, as evidenced by the 1,000+ teams in the Chicago area, across hundreds of leagues. 
    I used to pitch in one myself. (Go Snails!)
