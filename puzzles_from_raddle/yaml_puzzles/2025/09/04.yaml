    This week on Raddle we're featuring horror movie villains. 
    The Blair Witch is the titular antagonist of *The Blair Witch Project* (1999). 
    The original film was a seminal work in the genre of creepy found footage, 
    and became a breakthrough hit partially due to its marketing campaign that blurred the lines between fake documentary and real.
