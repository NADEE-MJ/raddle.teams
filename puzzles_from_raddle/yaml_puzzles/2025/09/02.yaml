  message:
    This week on Raddle we're featuring horror movie villains. 
    Ghostface is the name of the villain in the *Scream* franchise. 
    The costume was developed for Halloween stores in the early '90s â it's ubiquity is part of what makes the costume so powerful. Anyone could be hiding inside!
    While it resembles the face in Edvard Munch's *The Scream*, the mask's designer claims that they were not inspired by the painting.
