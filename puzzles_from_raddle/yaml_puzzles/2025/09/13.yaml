  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. 
    The original Ferris Wheel debuted at the 1893 Chicago Worldâs Fair. It was gigantic, weighing more than 2,000,000 pounds, containing 3,000 light bulbs and rising to 264 feet, with each of its 36 cars able to hold up to 60 people. It was the tallest attraction at the fair and would go on to inspire countless other Ferris Wheels around the world, including the permanent one at ï»¿Chicago's Navy Pier.
