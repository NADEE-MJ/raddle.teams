  message:
    This week on Raddle we're featuring horror movie villains. What better way to start than with It, aka Pennywise, aka Pennywise the Dancing Clown. I'm a horror movie weenie, so I haven't seen or read *It*, and only when researching this did I learn that the clown isn't actually a human, but a 
    "trans-dimensional malevolent entity". I guess that would have been less pithy of a name. Sorry, I mean less p-it-hy.
