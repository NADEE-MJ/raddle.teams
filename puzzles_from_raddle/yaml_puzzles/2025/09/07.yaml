    "This week on Raddle we're featuring horror movie villains.
    The Thing is the the thing in *The Thing* (1982), directed by John Carpenter.
    It is an extraterrestrial lifeform that assimilates and imitates other organisms.
    I was too scared to watch this movie as a kid, but I'm eager to now, except I can't get my kids to let me put it on. I wonder why not."
