  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. 
    A roller derby is a roller skating competition with roots in Chicago. 
    Leo Seltzer trademarked the term âRoller Derbyâ in 1935 and hosted the first one in Chicago, inviting both men and women. 
    The roller track became a symbol of feminist freedom, and many all-women leagues still exist in Chicago.
