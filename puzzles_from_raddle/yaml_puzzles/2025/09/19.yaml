  difficulty: medium
  theme: Chicago
  message:
    This week, we’re celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. 
    A roller derby is a roller skating competition with roots in Chicago. 
    Leo Seltzer trademarked the term “Roller Derby” in 1935 and hosted the first one in Chicago, inviting both men and women. 
    The roller track became a symbol of feminist freedom, and many all-women leagues still exist in Chicago.
