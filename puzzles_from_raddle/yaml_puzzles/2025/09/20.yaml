  message:
    This week, weâre celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. 
    House music developed in the 1980s within Black, Latino and gay communities in Chicago. 
    The genre is characterized by repetitive dance beats, a fast tempo and off-beat drums. 
    It would later influence major artists like Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and Lady Gaga.
