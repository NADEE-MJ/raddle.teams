  theme: Pride Month
  message: "We're celebrating Pride Month with Raddles inspired by LGBTQ+ anthems.
    \"Dancing Queen\" by ABBA is a classic, and it was a #1 hit for the band in the US — yet, incredibly, the only one they had here.
    Unsurprisingly, its legacy lives on in dance clubs and pride parades and movie soundracks and [presidential campaigns](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/08/mccain-former-prisoner-war-i-abba/)."
