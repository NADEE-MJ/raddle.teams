    In celebration of Juneteeth, we're building Raddles honoring Black inventors. 
    "[Sarah Boone](https://nbindustrial.org/blog/black-history-sarah-boone) was awarded a patent for the modern ironing board in 1892, 
    becoming one of the first Black American woman to do so.
    She was born in 1832 in North Carolina to enslaved parents and married a free man named James Boone in 1847.
    In her patent application, she stated the ironing board would be \"a cheap, simple, and highly effective device.\""
