  message:
    In celebration of Juneteeth, we're building Raddles honoring Black inventors. 
    The automatic elevator door was invented by [Alexander Miles](https://www.invent.org/inductees/alexander-miles), a Black man born in Ohio in 1838. 
    Before he patented his design in 1887, doors were opened manually and often left open. Passengers would occasionally fall into the shafts. 
    Miles' invention saved lives and made taking a lift easier and more convenient.
