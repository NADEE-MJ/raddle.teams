    \"Mountain dew\" was Appalachian slang for moonshine, which Barney and Ally Hartman used as inspiration for their soft drink brand, first bottled in 1932.
    It was originally intended to be used as a mixer with whiskey, if you can imagine.
    (This week's Raddles each use one of the 6 terrains from Settlers of Catan: hill, forest, field, mountain, pasture, or desert.)
