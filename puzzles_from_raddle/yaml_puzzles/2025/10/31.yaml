  title: From GEORGE to SMILEY
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Whodunit
  message: 
    "A murder has been committed at our Halloween party! Seven witnesses (in costume) have given testimony, in the form of Raddles. 
    Our sixth witness is George Smiley, who's been around a mystery or two.
    His hint: consider why _these_ characters make good witnesses, and not others. 
    Someone dressed as, say, Bo Peep, or Meriadoc Brandybuck, would not fit in a Raddle-based mystery.
    [Update: the solution [can be found here](/mystery/whodunit)]"
