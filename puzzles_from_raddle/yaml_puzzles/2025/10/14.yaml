    Settlers of Catan was my first foray into strategic board games.
    It was the game that launched an unreasonable board game collection.
    The game is played on a game board made up of 19 tiles.
    Each tile is one of 6 different terrains: hill, forest, field, mountain, pasture, or desert.
    This week's Raddles each use one of those terrains.
