  title: From BLACK to MAIL
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Crime Fiction
  message: This week’s Raddles unpack common tropes in crime fiction.
    The “mail” part of blackmail doesn’t mean sending letters; it comes from a Scottish term for paying rent.
    The “black” part denoted payment by goods or labor, as opposed to “white rent” paid in silver.
    One of the most notable mystery novels with blackmail is Raymond Chandler’s “The Big Sleep,” later adapted to film by Howard Hawks, featuring the captivating Bogey and Bacall.
