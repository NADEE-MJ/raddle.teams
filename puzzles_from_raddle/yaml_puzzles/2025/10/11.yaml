  theme: Make Some Noise
  message: "This week's Raddles are in honor of the upcoming season of \"[Make Some\
    \ Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKBcWn-tqWE),\" which premieres on Monday,\
    \ October 13.
    The Noise Boys are the trio of Josh Ruben, Zac Oyama, and Brennan Lee Mulligan, who appear on the show together once per season, usually in the season's first episode.
    Each is a hilarious improvisor on his own, but together they produce a chemistry way greater than the sum of its parts."
