  title: From TREND to SETTER
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Dog Days of Summer
  message:
    August is the "dog days" of summer, so we're featuring Raddles built around phrases that have a dog breed in them. 
    Today we recognize the Setter, often English or Irish, who are also named because of the stance they take when finding game, such as quail or grouse. 
    Such a good doggy.
