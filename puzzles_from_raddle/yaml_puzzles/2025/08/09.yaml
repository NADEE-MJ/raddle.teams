  difficulty: medium
  theme: Dog Days of Summer
  message:
    August is the "dog days" of summer, so we're featuring Raddles built around dog breeds. 
    The Maltese, despite its name, might not actually have originated in the island country of Malta. 
    Itâs a tiny, white dog with a glossy coat â and itâs hypoallergenic, which is good news to those with dog allergies. 
    And who wouldnât want to cuddle with a dog that looks like a teddy bear?
