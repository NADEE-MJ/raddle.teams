  title: From DOGS to WAR
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Shakespearean phrases
  message:
    We just finished our âdog days of summerâ theme, and what better transition to our new theme â phrases coined by William Shakespeare â than âlet slip the dogs of warâ? 
    This phrase is spoken by Mark Antony in Act III, Scene I of Shakespeareâs âJulius Caesar.â Caesarâs death (spoiler alert!) is seen as a bad omen for the future of Rome.
