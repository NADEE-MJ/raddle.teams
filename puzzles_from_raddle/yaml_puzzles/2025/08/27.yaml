    This weekâs Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Todayâs is âWild Horses,â from the bandâs 1971 album âSticky Fingers.â It was written by Keith Richards for his newborn son and later rewritten by Jagger, possibly inspired by his crumbling relationship with Marianne Faithfull. In 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle (of âBritainâs Got Talentâ fame) covered the song; Jagger called it â[much better than](https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/mick-jagger-thinks-susan-boyles-version-of-wild-horses-is-better-than-his-62325012-237661821)â anything heâd ever done.
