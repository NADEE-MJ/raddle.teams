  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Rolling Stones
  message:
    "This weekâs Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Todayâs is âPaint It Blackâ â sometimes stylized as âPaint It, Blackâ â which came out in 1966. Its use of sitar immediately sparked comparisons to the Beatles, who had also begun experimenting with elements of Indian music. Guitarist Brian Jonesâ response to the comparison: âWhat utter rubbish.â"
