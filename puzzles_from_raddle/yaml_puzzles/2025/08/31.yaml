  difficulty: medium
  theme: Rolling Stones
  message:
    This weekâs Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Todayâs is âBrown Sugar,â the lead single from their 1971 album âSticky Fingers.â The notoriously raunchy song was controversial then and now â 
    the Stones [dropped it](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/rolling-stones-pull-brown-sugar-song-lyrics-about-slavery-live-n1281459) from their live concert setlist in 2021. In a 1995 interview with [Rolling Stone](https://web.archive.org/web/20091205235627/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5) (the magazine, not the band), Mick Jagger said, âI never would write that song now. Iâd think, âOh God, I canât. Iâve got to stop.ââ
