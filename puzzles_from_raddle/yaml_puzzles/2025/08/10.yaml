  theme: Dog Days of Summer
  message:
    August is the "dog days" of summer, so we're featuring Raddles built around dog breeds. Pomeranians, or Poms, are small, fluffy dogs â but they weren't always that way.
    They used to weigh around 30 pounds and were used for pulling sleds. 
    But then Queen Victoria popularized a smaller version of the breed, and then everyone wanted them that small.
    Poms were selectively bred, until they reached their current toy size of 3-7 pounds.
