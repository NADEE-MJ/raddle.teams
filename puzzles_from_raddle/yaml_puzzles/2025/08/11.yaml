  title: From YANKEE to DOODLE

  difficulty: medium
  theme: Dog Days of Summer
  message:
    One last dog breed-themed for the dog days of August.
    Except that doodle isn't a dog breed; rather it's a cross between a poodle and some other breed.
    You got your labradoodles, golden doodles, bernedoodles, schnoodles, and even corgipoos. 
    Everyone wants to poodle.
    I guess this means poodles are the greatest breed. (And the greatest of them all is our 7-year-old standard, Cleo.)
