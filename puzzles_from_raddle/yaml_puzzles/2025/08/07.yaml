  theme: Dog Days of Summer
  message:
    August is the "dog days" of summer, so we're featuring Raddles built around phrases that have a dog breed in them. 
    Today we recognize the Lab, or Labrador Retriever, a friendly breed named after their homeland, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
    Not to be confused with the Newfoundland (or Newfie), who run bigger and fluffier. Both are excellent doggies.
