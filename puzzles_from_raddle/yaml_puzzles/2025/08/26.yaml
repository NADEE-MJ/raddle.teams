  title: From RUBY to TUESDAY
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Rolling Stones
  message:
    This weekâs Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Todayâs is âRuby Tuesday,â released in 1966 with âLetâs Spend the Night Together.â The restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, which formed a corporation thirty years later in 1996, took its name from the song, though they donât seem to have collaborated with the band for any menu items (really, no âBeast of Burdenâ burgers?).
