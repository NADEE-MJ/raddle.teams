    "This weekâs Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Todayâs is âGimme Shelter,â the first track from their 1969 album âLet It Bleed.â In an interview with NPR, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Jagger said about the song: âIt was a very moody piece about the world closing in on you a bit [â¦] When it was recorded, early '69 or something, it was a time of war and tension, so that's reflected in this tune. It's still wheeled out when big storms happen, as they did the other week. It's been used a lot to evoke natural disaster.â "
