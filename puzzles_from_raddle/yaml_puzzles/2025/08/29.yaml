  title: From SYMPATHY to THE DEVIL
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Rolling Stones
  message:
    This weekâs Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Todayâs is âSympathy for the Devilâ from the bandâs 1968 album âBeggars Banquet.â 
    One particularly striking line â âI shouted out, âWho killed the Kennedys?â / When after all, it was you and meâ â has been omitted from live performances since 2006. Jagger, answering a question about the missing line, said, âDid I leave that out? That song is so long, I always cut a verse.â
