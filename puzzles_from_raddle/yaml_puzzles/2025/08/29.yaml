  title: From SYMPATHY to THE DEVIL
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Rolling Stones
  message:
    This week’s Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Today’s is “Sympathy for the Devil” from the band’s 1968 album “Beggars Banquet.” 
    One particularly striking line — “I shouted out, ‘Who killed the Kennedys?’ / When after all, it was you and me” — has been omitted from live performances since 2006. Jagger, answering a question about the missing line, said, “Did I leave that out? That song is so long, I always cut a verse.”
