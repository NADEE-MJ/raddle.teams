  title: From MORTAL to COIL
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds
  difficulty: medium
  theme: Shakespearean phrases
  message:
    "Todayâs theme comes from Act III, Scene I of \"Hamlet,\" when our boy Hammie delivers his big \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy: 
    \"When we have shuffled off this mortal coilâ¦\" The phrase takes a pretty pessimistic view of life, though you would probably be pessimistic, too, if your uncle murdered your father to seize the throne and also married your mother."
