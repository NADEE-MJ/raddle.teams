  title: From MORTAL to COIL
  author: Sandy Weisz and Mao Reynolds

  message:
    "Today’s theme comes from Act III, Scene I of \"Hamlet,\" when our boy Hammie delivers his big \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy:
    \"When we have shuffled off this mortal coil…\" The phrase takes a pretty pessimistic view of life, though you would probably be pessimistic, too, if your uncle murdered your father to seize the throne and also married your mother."
