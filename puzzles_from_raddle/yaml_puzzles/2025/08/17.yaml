  theme: Shakespearean phrases
  message:
    "Today's theme comes from Act II, Scene II of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" in which Ancient Pistol, speaking to John Falstaff, says: \"Why then the worldâs mine oyster, / Which I with sword will open.\" Oysters donât open freely; they must be forced open, and Pistol argues the same logic applies to taking advantage of life."
