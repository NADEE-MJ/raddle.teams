    "Today's Raddle is by Momes, Dob Olino, & Bob Weisz.
    They write, \"We chose the two main characters from one of our favorite films of the year, [_Sinners_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sinners-2025/), a deeply moving and stunning feat of cinema that's so much more than just a vampire movie. The twin brothers at the center of it all — named Smoke and Stack — made perfect sense as a theme. Also, one of our members, Bob, is brothers with Raddle's creator Sandy, and (no joke) their family comes from Transylvania! The coincidence is kind of spooky... mwahahaaaa\""
