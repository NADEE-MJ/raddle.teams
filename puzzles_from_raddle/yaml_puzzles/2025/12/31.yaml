    "Today's Raddle is by Mark Halpin. Mark writes,
    \"My recommendation is Rian Johnson's twisty mystery '[Wake Up Dead Man](https://letterboxd.com/film/wake-up-dead-man/)'.
    The third outing for detective Benoit Blanc doesn't swing for the comedic fences like its predecessor The Glass Onion, as it has more serious things on its mind, but it's still as wildly entertaining as that and the original 'Knives Out'.
    The mystery is intricate and fair, and the cast throughout is fantastic.\""
