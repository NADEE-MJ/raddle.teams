    "Now we're on to the heavy games. [Stationfall](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316624/stationfall) was one of my favorite games of the year, but be warned: it's complex and chaotic.
    You play a character trying to survive a disintegrating space station, or possibly stay on it as it plummets.
    There are a dozen or more characters on the board, and no one knows which one you are. Meanwhile you have a secret agenda you're trying to accomplish.
    What's wild about this game is that every one of Stationfall's mechanics feel justified by the theme and then story that is emerging from the collection of decisions being made.
    It's a lot, but it's hella fun."
