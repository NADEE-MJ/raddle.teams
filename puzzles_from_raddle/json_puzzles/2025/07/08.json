    "message": "The Tour de France starts this week in Lille, France. We're celebrating with Raddles that are vaguely bicycle-themed. According to the OED (not that one, [this one](https://www.etymonline.com/word/basket%20case)), the phrase “basket case” was coined to refer to World War I soldiers with amputated arms and legs, thus having to be carried in a basket. This etymology was disputed by an army surgeon general that same year, but the phrase grew popular nonetheless. Of course you may know it best as the title of [this banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTGr5t3MoY)."
