A rainbow contains seven main colors, red through violet, often memorized with the term Roy G. Biv. It was Isaac Newton who pushed for the inclusion of indigo, a tertiary color, in the rainbow canon, though his definition of indigo differs from our current perception: his indigo is our blue, and his blue was our cyan."
