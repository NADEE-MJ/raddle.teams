    "message": "Beer pong is typically associated with rowdy college frat houses, but it's also a common sight at block parties. A paddle version originated at Dartmouth in the 1950s, and a paddle-free variety later arose at Bucknell and LeHigh. The game — or, as some argue, the sport — has since spawned several professional leagues along with the World Series of Beer Pong."
