    "message": "Corn hole, also called Sack Toss or simply Bags, is a block party staple. Players throw bean bags (historically filled with dried corn kernels, hence the name) at boards, earning one point for landing on the board and three points for getting it in the hole. A similar game called Parlor Quoits received a patent in 1883, but used a square hole rather than a circular one."
