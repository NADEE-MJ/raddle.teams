    "message": "This week, we're celebrating block parties. American block parties likely originated in New York City as a way to honor neighbors who were fighting abroad in World War I. Later, in the 1970s, hip-hop artists popularized block parties as cultural events where DJs and performers could showcase their music and build community, transforming them into birthplaces of a new musical movement."
