Drew](https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/african-americans-in-sciences/charles-richard-drew.html) is called the “father of the blood bank” for his contributions to chemistry and surgery. He invented bloodmobiles, which were trucks with refrigerators able to preserve blood donations, and developed ways to collect and store large amounts of plasma, techniques the American Red Cross would later adapt."
