Calle](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/february-2/alfred-cralle-invents-ice-cream-scoop) worked as a porter at a drugstore in Pittsburgh, where he noticed his coworkers struggled to scoop ice cream for customers. This observation led to Calle creating the ice cream scoop, which he patented in 1897, becoming the first Black man in Pittsburgh to earn a patent."
