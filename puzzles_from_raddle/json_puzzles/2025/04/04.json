    "message": "[This week](/2025/04/01), I'm building Raddles around acts we saw at Big Ears. [Yo La Tengo](https://matadorrecords.com/pages/artists/yo-la-tengo) played twice, once alone, and once with the jazz legends of the [Sun Ra Arkestra](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5V5vvh5MgM7vDuPp4lJYkh), which we got to see. They went back and forth playing each other's songs, blending rock and jazz, mellow and bombastic, high and low. It was an unexpected treat."
