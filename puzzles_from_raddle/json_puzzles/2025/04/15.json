The first plague is Blood, which refers to the Nile River turning to blood. The second plague, Frogs, refers to an infenstation of frogs that swarmed the land. Though I recently saw a meme going around that suggests it might have just been [one big frog](https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/ivish9/the_plague_of_frog/)."
