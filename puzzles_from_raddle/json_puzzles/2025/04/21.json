    "message": "[Blue Prince](https://www.blueprincegame.com/) is an incredible new video game that has been taking over all of my (and my son's) free time. ([And many others](https://www.polygon.com/news/561251/blue-prince-steam-data-hours).) It's a roguelike exploration game, where you're uncovering the mystery of a mansion that was left to you by your ancestor. But every day you start over from scratch, and every day the doors in the mansion lead to different rooms in a arrangement that's different than the day before. And the key to solving the mystery is to solve the puzzles embedded within. Hard recommend."
