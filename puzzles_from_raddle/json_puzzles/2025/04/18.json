    "message": "At the end of the Seder we traditionally sing \"[One Little Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Gadya)\" (\"Chad Gadya\"). It's a cumulative song — each verse adds a new character to the story. The first verse is about a goat, the second verse is about a cat that eats the goat, and so on. I considered writing Raddles that traverse the whole chain in the song, but I didn't want to burden myself with finding a chain from ANGEL OF DEATH to THE HOLY ONE BLESSED BE HE. Please enjoy [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7_2WtzqvzM) of Jack Black singing the song."
