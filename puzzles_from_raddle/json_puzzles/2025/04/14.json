    "message": "Passover began at sundown on Saturday the 12th and lasts until sundown on the 20th. The name Passover comes from the story of God passing over the homes of the Jews during the tenth and final plague. We celebrate Passover with a Seder, an structured meal that includes the retelling of the Exodus story. The Raddles this week will be based on some terms and traditions from the Seder."
