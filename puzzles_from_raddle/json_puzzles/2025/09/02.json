    "message": "This week on Raddle we're featuring horror movie villains. Ghostface is the name of the villain in the *Scream* franchise. The costume was developed for Halloween stores in the early '90s — it's ubiquity is part of what makes the costume so powerful. Anyone could be hiding inside! While it resembles the face in Edvard Munch's *The Scream*, the mask's designer claims that they were not inspired by the painting."
