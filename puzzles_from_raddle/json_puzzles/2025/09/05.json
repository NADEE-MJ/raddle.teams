    "message": "This week on Raddle we're featuring horror movie villains. Candyman, the alias of Daniel Robitaille, was created by writer Clive Barker and first appeared in his 1985 short story \"The Forbidden.\" Candyman has a hook hand and will appear if you say his name five times in front of a mirror. Meanwhile, \"The Candy Man\" is a song from *Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory*, an entirely different (but also somewhat creepy) movie."
