        "message": "This week, we’re celebrating some of the great things that have come out of Chicago, our home town. Deep dish pizza is a food synonymous with the city; it was invented here in 1943. Visitors will often make a pilgrimage to one of the city’s many famous deep dish pizzerias, such as Lou Malnati’s or Giordano’s. Most Chicagoans don’t eat it often — it’s more of a special treat — instead preferring Chicago’s other signature pizza style, the thin-crusted tavern-style."
