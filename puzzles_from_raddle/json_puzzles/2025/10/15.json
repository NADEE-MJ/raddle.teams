We conspired on their [Clandestine edition](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/clandestine) a few years back. We're working with them on a new little thing. To find out about it when it launches, I might recommend joining their [mailing list](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/thelist). (This week's Raddles each use one of the 6 terrains from Settlers of Catan: hill, forest, field, mountain, pasture, or desert.) "
