The first murder mystery, according to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Collins-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&) was “The Notting Hill Mystery,” published in 1862 under the pseudonym Charles Felix. Like a dogged detective tracking down the culprit, the Times found that the true identity of Felix was Charles Warren Adams, an English lawyer, publisher and anti-vivisectionist (that is, someone opposed to animal experimentation). The latest murder mystery is a \"Murder Book\" puzzle that we made with our friends at Field Notes. [Get one here](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/dispatches/wednesday-murder-club)!"
