    "message": " Settlers of Catan was my first foray into strategic board games. It was the game that launched an unreasonable board game collection. The game is played on a game board made up of 19 tiles. Each tile is one of 6 different terrains: hill, forest, field, mountain, pasture, or desert. This week's Raddles each use one of those terrains. A mole hill is a small mound of earth created by a mole. Or, in an common expression, a small problem that shouldn't be turned into a mountain. "
