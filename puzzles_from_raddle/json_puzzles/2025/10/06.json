It's a regular Monday night ritual in our house and one of the best things on the internet. Each show features three improvisers, one host, and a set of bonkers improvisational prompts. \"Make Some Noise\" is available with a subscription to [Dropout](https://signup.dropout.tv/), which is well worth it."
