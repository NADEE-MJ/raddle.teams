    "message": "This week’s Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Today’s is “Wild Horses,” from the band’s 1971 album “Sticky Fingers.” It was written by Keith Richards for his newborn son and later rewritten by Jagger, possibly inspired by his crumbling relationship with Marianne Faithfull. In 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle (of “Britain’s Got Talent” fame) covered the song; Jagger called it “[much better than](https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/mick-jagger-thinks-susan-boyles-version-of-wild-horses-is-better-than-his-62325012-237661821)” anything he’d ever done."
