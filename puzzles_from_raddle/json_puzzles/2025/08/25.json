    "message": "This week’s Raddles are inspired by songs by the Rolling Stones. Today’s is “Gimme Shelter,” the first track from their 1969 album “Let It Bleed.” In an interview with NPR, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Jagger said about the song: “It was a very moody piece about the world closing in on you a bit […] When it was recorded, early '69 or something, it was a time of war and tension, so that's reflected in this tune. It's still wheeled out when big storms happen, as they did the other week. It's been used a lot to evoke natural disaster.” "
