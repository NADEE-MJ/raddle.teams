Today’s is “Brown Sugar,” the lead single from their 1971 album “Sticky Fingers.” The notoriously raunchy song was controversial then and now — the Stones [dropped it](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/rolling-stones-pull-brown-sugar-song-lyrics-about-slavery-live-n1281459) from their live concert setlist in 2021. In a 1995 interview with [Rolling Stone](https://web.archive.org/web/20091205235627/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5) (the magazine, not the band), Mick Jagger said, “I never would write that song now. I’d think, ‘Oh God, I can’t. I’ve got to stop.’”"
