The [Pixie](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Pixie) is a character that knows about another character's existence in the game, and must act as if they are that character. Then, when that other character dies, the Pixie gets to take on their powers. The [Soldier](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Soldier) doesn't usually die too early in a game, so this Pixie maybe waiting around for a while to turn into one."
