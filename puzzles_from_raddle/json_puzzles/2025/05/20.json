Today we honor the [Cannibal](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Cannibal), a character who waits for characters to die and then subsumes their powers. The [Butler](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Butler)'s powers aren't useful to take on, but the Cannibal doesn't get a choice; they just eat whatever corpse comes along. That's how the game goes sometimes."
