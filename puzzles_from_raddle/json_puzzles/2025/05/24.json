The [Snake Charmer](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Snake_Charmer) is a good character who picks a player every night, and if they happen to snipe the Demon, they swap roles with that Demon. The Demon could be any number of characters, but in the case of this puzzle, we're looking at the [Po](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Po), a demon who has a choice every night: either kill one person or do nothing. If they do nothing, the next night, they get to kill three people!"
