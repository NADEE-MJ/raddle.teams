The [Farmer](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Farmer) is one of the most powerful good characters in the game. Their only power is that when they die, another player turns into the Farmer. Which provides an immediate and mechanically confirmable chain of trust between two good players, a huge boon for the good team. In this case, the Storyteller chose the [Professor](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Professor) to turn into the Farmer. The farm's a long way from academia, so here's hoping the Professor can hack it."
