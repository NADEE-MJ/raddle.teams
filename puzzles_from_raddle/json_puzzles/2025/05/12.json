    "message": "We're honoring the Tony nominations this week. And we're starting with a show that I got to see and absolutely adored, *Operation Mincemeat*. It began in London, where it saw huge success, winning the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, and now it's nominated for a Tony Award for Best Musical. The plot seems like an odd choice for a musical — it's the true story of a British intelligence operation during World War II that involved planting a corpse with fake documents — but the music is so catchy and the production, which only uses five actors taking on multiple roles each, is such a joy to behold. I can't recommend it enough."
