The [Marionette](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Marionette) is a Minion — which means they work for the evil team. However, they start the game *thinking* they are a good character — in this case, the [Gambler](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Gambler). Then they spend the game getting false info but thinking it's true, which is a big boon for the side of evil. It's up to the Demon to tell the Marionette who they are. In this case, the Marionette-as-Gambler is spending the game guessing people's roles and thinking they were getting them all correctly. Nothing as dangerous as a gambler on an artificial hot streak."
