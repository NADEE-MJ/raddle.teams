    "message": "Today's Raddle is by Adal Rifai. Adal writes, \"My wife and I both love video games but are typically at opposite ends of the spectrum; me hacking my way through Elden Ring and her cozied up to Yoshi's Crafted World. However [Split Fiction](https://www.ea.com/en/games/split-fiction/split-fiction) is the rare game/couch co-op that we both adored. In the same vein (and from the same studio Hazelight) as the incredible 'It Takes Two', 'Split Fiction' oscillates at a great pace between playing in sci-fi and fantasy worlds. From riding gravity-defying motorcycles and wielding a laser whip, to playing as farting pigs searching for apples, this game is an absolute delight.\""
