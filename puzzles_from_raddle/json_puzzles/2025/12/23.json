    "message": "Today's Raddle is by Rita Orlov. Rita writes, \"[The Séance of Blake Manor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/) is a supernatural detective mystery.  After arriving in a remote hotel full of otherworldly occurrences, you must investigate the disappearance of a specific guest, as well as uncover the secrets of many others. I enjoyed exploring the house, talking to the characters, and learning a little about Celtic mythology throughout the game. Many mysteries to unravel!\""
