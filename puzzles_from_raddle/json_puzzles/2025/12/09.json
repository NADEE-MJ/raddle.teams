    "message": "[Cursed Court](https://atlas-games.com/product_tables/AG1400) is the rare game that works best at 5 or 6 people. It's a wagering game, where everyone at the table has different, limited information. But, as the game progresses, you use other players' wagers to learn more information — unless they're just bluffing to throw you off the scent. The rules are fairly simple, it's lovely to look at, it's very tactile (as you're holding a stack of betting chips), and it's always fun to try to solve who knows what. Another recommendation that has a similar vibe but plays well at 3-4: [Courtisans](https://www.amazon.com/Pandasaurus-Games-Courtisans-Card-Game/dp/B0CZFYQY5H)."
