    "message": "Many of the games on this list play well at two players, but [Sky Team](https://www.hachetteboardgames.com/products/sky-team) is designed specifically for two. In it, you and a partner are co-pilots who need to land a plane at an airport. You do this by rolling dice and positioning them in precisely the right order. The catch: you can't see your partner's dice, or talk about what you dice you each have. The box comes with 21 scenarios of increasing difficulty. It's tense and rewards repeated play. But if planes aren't your bag, here's another two-person game that's a go-to for us: [Splendor Duel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/364073/splendor-duel)."
