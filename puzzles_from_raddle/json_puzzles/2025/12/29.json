    "message": "Today's Raddle is by Wil Zambole. Wil writes, \"[The Life of Chuck](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-life-of-chuck/) is a fantastic film starring Tom Hiddleston, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillian, and Mark Hamill. It is based on a non-horror short story by Stephen King. I was absolutely stunned by how lovely, powerful, and unique this film was. It is not a typical story, and it’s not told in a typical way. The whole thing for me was emotional and uplifting at the same time. The message is thoughtful, subtle, and it may get lost, but it ties the story together very well.\""
