    "message": "Today's Raddle is by Ben Tausig with his son Julian. Ben writes, \"I'm very interested in categories of food that occur in different forms in many places throughout the world, such as fried dough pockets (empanadas, beignets, hotteok, et al) and dumplings (pierogi, ravioli, momos). I recently introduced my kids to arancini, Sicilian fried rice balls, and soon we'll be visiting Japan, and surely eating lots of onigiri there. Ghanaian omo tuo and Laotian khao tom are just two other versions of this frankly perfect culinary invention.\""
