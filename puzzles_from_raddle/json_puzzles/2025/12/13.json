    "message": "Another heavy one today: Ark Nova, currently ranked the [#2 game on all of Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova). And it deserves to be there. In it, you're running a zoo, building out enclosures for the animals while acquiring animals, funding conservation projects, and upgrading your system. The deck of cards is massive, so each game offers new ways to strategize and engine-build. It's a beast of a game, but it doesn't drag, assuming you like busting your brain on engine-building synergies for hours."
