    "message": "Today's Raddle is by Nathan Curtis. Nathan writes, \"[Hades II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/) is an action roguelike from Supergiant Games. In Hades II, you play as Melinoë, daughter of Hades and Persephone, who is attempting to slay Chronos, the Titan of Time. In addition to the roguelike mechanic, Hades II features a wide variety of gods and mortals from Greek mythology, including a number of deep cuts. They take some liberties with the myths, but I mostly don't mind. Mostly.\""
