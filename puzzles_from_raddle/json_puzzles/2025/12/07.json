You're trying to get your teammates to pick certain words out of a grid, by using only a one-word clue. It's endlessly replayable, given the randomness of the setup each time. If you already have Codenames and want something similar, we also love [Decrypto](https://www.hachetteboardgames.com/products/decrypto)."
