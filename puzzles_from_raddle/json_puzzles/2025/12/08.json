    "message": "[Res Arcana](https://store.asmodee.com/products/res-arcana) is a very tight engine builder that I never get sick of playing. In each game, you only get eight cards (out of a deck of dozens), and the game demands you figure out how to build an engine with them. Each card can be invoked to add to your engine, or can be exchanged for resources, and then put back into your deck. The expansions are also great. For something similar, I also recommend [The Vale of Eternity](https://renegadegamestudios.com/the-vale-of-eternity/), another engine builder that's a little simpler but no less fun."
