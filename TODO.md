Things to fix:

1. admin loading icon is not centered on the page, same with lobby, same with game i believe

tests to look into in the future:

1. reconnect flow test
2. lobby no session access
3. duplicate player names

tests to create:

1. test admin sees a player leaving and joining via websocket updates (i think this already exists)
